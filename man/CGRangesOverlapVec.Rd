\title{Vectorized overlap query for CGRanges}
\usage{
CGRangesOverlapVec(cr, chrom, start, end)
}
\arguments{
\item{cr}{External pointer to CGRanges object}

\item{chrom}{Character vector of chromosome names}

\item{start}{Integer vector of start positions (1-based)}

\item{end}{Integer vector of end positions (1-based, inclusive)}
}
\value{
List of integer vectors, each containing the indices of overlapping intervals
}
\description{
Performs overlap queries against a CGRanges index for multiple intervals simultaneously.
This is more efficient than calling CGRangesOverlap multiple times.
}
