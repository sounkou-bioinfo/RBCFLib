context_demo output and its analysis.  Jan 5-6, 2022.

legend: threads (a,b):  outer parallelism uses a parallel loop with
num_threads(a), and inner loop uses num_threads(b), for a total of a*b threads.
The context_demo constructs 1 to 64 matrices, all the same, with
GrB_Matrix_build, type: FP64, n-by-n with n = 100,000, and nvals = 20
million.  Bulk of the time would be spent in the parallel merge sort.
The GraphBLAS merge sort uses a sequence of parallel for loops, with
#pragma omp parallel for num_threads(b) schedule(dynamic,1)
with each iteration a large "task" (not an OpenMP task).

hypersparse is a 20-core, 40-thread Intel Xeon  CPU E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20GHz,
with Ubuntu 20.04.
    
Mixed parallelism is slow with gcc 9.4.0 and libgomp.
Consider the time to build 64 matrices with 1 and 32 threads:

   with gcc 9.4.0 and its included libgomp: bad results
   threads (   1,   1):    1 time: 248.3557 sec speedup:    1.000
   ...
   threads (   1,  32):   32 time:  28.6471 sec speedup:    8.669
   threads (   2,  16):   32 time: 140.2951 sec speedup:    1.770   <== Yikes!!
   threads (   4,   8):   32 time:  72.8835 sec speedup:    3.408
   threads (   8,   4):   32 time:  40.4137 sec speedup:    6.145
   threads (  16,   2):   32 time:  25.8655 sec speedup:    9.602
   threads (  32,   1):   32 time:  17.4474 sec speedup:   14.235

The same work done with icx 2022.0.1 and libiomp5 shows no such slowdown,
and all 6 methods take roughly the same time, although it's fastest to
build all 64 matrices with a=32 threads in the outer loop, and b=1 thread
for each GrB_Matrix_build (which then uses a single-threaded qsort, not
a merge sort):

   with icx 2022.0.1 and its included libiomp: great results
   threads (   1,   1):    1 time: 249.5680 sec speedup:    1.000
   ...
   threads (   1,  32):   32 time:  30.4074 sec speedup:    8.207
   threads (   2,  16):   32 time:  26.5007 sec speedup:    9.417   <== good!
   threads (   4,   8):   32 time:  24.5964 sec speedup:   10.147
   threads (   8,   4):   32 time:  22.7695 sec speedup:   10.961
   threads (  16,   2):   32 time:  19.7543 sec speedup:   12.634
   threads (  32,   1):   32 time:  17.5195 sec speedup:   14.245

The (1,32) and (32,1) times for gcc-9.4 and icx 2022.0.1 are about the
same (~30 sec and ~17 sec for both).  It's the mixed parallelism where
gcc 9.4 struggles.

I then tried gcc 12.2.0 with libgomp (both from slack).  The libgomp was
installed with gcc 12.2.0.  This version of gcc fixes the multi-level
parallelism problem of gcc 9.4.0:

   with gcc 12.2.0 and its included libgomp: great results
   threads (   1,   1):    1 time: 256.8161 sec speedup:    1.000
   ...
   threads (   1,  32):   32 time:  29.2369 sec speedup:    8.784
   threads (   2,  16):   32 time:  25.6922 sec speedup:    9.996   <== good!
   threads (   4,   8):   32 time:  24.2922 sec speedup:   10.572
   threads (   8,   4):   32 time:  22.4136 sec speedup:   11.458
   threads (  16,   2):   32 time:  20.2493 sec speedup:   12.683
   threads (  32,   1):   32 time:  17.5978 sec speedup:   14.594

gcc 12.2.0 completely solves the performance bug of gcc 9.4.0.  These results
were from GraphBLAS/Demo/Program/context_demo.c, which I will tag as
GraphbBLAS v8.0.0.alpha1 (not for production use but I want to save the entire
code base that generated these results).

It must be said that to create these 64 matrices with 32 threads, the fastest
method is (32,1), to use one thread to create any given matrix.  The
parallelism is obvious there.  However, multi-level parallelism is useful in
other harder cases.

M1 MacBook Air 2020 with gcc 12 and libgomp (Apple Silicon, native gcc-12)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8 hardware cores (4 performance, 4 efficiency cores).  To build 16 matrices,
each the same size as done on hypersparse, no problems with mixing levels
of parallelism.

   M1 MacBook Air:
   threads (   1,   1):    1 time:  35.7127 sec speedup:    1.000
   ...
   threads (   1,   8):    8 time:   9.3390 sec speedup:    3.824
   threads (   2,   4):    8 time:   8.9232 sec speedup:    4.002
   threads (   4,   2):    8 time:   8.7156 sec speedup:    4.098
   threads (   8,   1):    8 time:   8.4503 sec speedup:    4.226

   Compare the same on hypersparse with 8 threads, 16 matrices, gcc and
   libgomp, where 1 thread takes 62.1 seconds:
   threads (   1,   1):    1 time:  62.1321 sec speedup:    1.000
   ...
   threads (   1,   8):    8 time:  11.4431 sec speedup:    5.430
   threads (   2,   4):    8 time:  34.9561 sec speedup:    1.777   <=== Yikes!
   threads (   4,   2):    8 time:  18.1864 sec speedup:    3.416   <=== Yikes!
   threads (   8,   1):    8 time:   8.9714 sec speedup:    6.926

   hypersparse with icx 2022.0.1, libiomp, 8 threads, 16 matrices:
   threads (   1,   8):    8 time:  10.3597 sec speedup:    6.003
   threads (   2,   4):    8 time:   9.9368 sec speedup:    6.258
   threads (   4,   2):    8 time:   9.9705 sec speedup:    6.237
   threads (   8,   1):    8 time:   9.0520 sec speedup:    6.870

   The problem with multiple levels of parallelism is fixed with gcc 12.2.0:
   hypersparse with gcc 12.2.0, libgomp, 8 threads, 16 matrices:
   threads (   1,   8):    8 time:  12.0057 sec speedup:    5.349
   threads (   2,   4):    8 time:  10.8107 sec speedup:    5.940   <== ok!!
   threads (   4,   2):    8 time:  10.5337 sec speedup:    6.096
